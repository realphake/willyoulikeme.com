				<p class="aboutus">When people or organizations post a status update on their Facebook timelines, they hope that all their Facebook friends will like the message, or at least read it. However, due to Facebook’s algorithms, their messages will only be seen by around 16% of their Facebook friends. Thus, maximizing the effectiveness of your audience (and through this generating larger audiences) can be an interesting topic in the context of Facebook. Here Will You Like Me? can be an opportunity.</p>
				
				<p class="aboutus">Will You Like Me? (WYLM) is a Facebook application that helps individual Facebook users and companies with generating a larger audience on Facebook, and increasing the efficiency of this reach, by helping to make a post more likable and increase the likes a post will receive. It shows you the predicted likes while typing a new status update. Besides showing the predicted likes, Will You Like Me? can possibly also calculate the best moment when the user can post the message. The application can be used just for fun, as well as for serious commercial purposes such as marketing.</p>
				
				<p class="aboutus">For this study data will be used that is freely available on Facebook. It is gathered using the Facebook API, specifically with the Graph API Explorer1. The collected data comes from Facebook pages with large amounts of likes, such as CNN and YouTube. Additionally, personal Facebook data of ourselves and other students that don’t mind sharing their data will be used.</p>

					<p class="aboutus">Will You Like Me is part of the Information Visualization master course at the University of Amsterdam. Therefore it is accompanied with four reports that can soon be downloaded below.</p>
					<p class="aboutus"><span class="bold">Dataset description document</span> (25 February 2014)</p>
					<p class="aboutus2">This document describes the data that is being used and where it is used for. It will start with a description of the data gathering process, followed by an explanation of every variable in the dataset. This also includes a description of how the data conforms to Stephen Few’s 9 principles of good data.</p>
					<p class="aboutus"><span class="bold">Interaction & evaluation design</span> (5 March 2014)</p>
					<p class="aboutus2">This paper includes the interaction and evaluation design of WYLM. It introduces the topic, and provided insights in the visualization components. The interaction components of the application are described using Yi's 7 categories. These interaction components are also accompanied by a state diagram that describes the four phases of user interaction. The system is evaluated using Van Wijk's economic model and evaluation suggestions from North are taken into account.</p>
					<p class="aboutus"><span class="bold">Perceptual & cognitive design</span> (18 March 2014)</p>
					<p class="aboutus2">This paper consists of the perceptual and cognitive design of WYLM. The perceptual design involves the process of minimizing human inadequacies in terms of understanding visualized information. The cognitive design involves a description of how Will You Like Me can amplify cognition.</p>
					<p class="aboutus"><span class="bold">Final report</span> (30 March 2014)</p>
					<p class="aboutus2">Coming soon.</p>
