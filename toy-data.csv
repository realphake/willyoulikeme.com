"Marvin Miller, Union Leader Who Changed Baseball, Dies at 95","Look back at the life and work of Marvin Miller who secured his place on baseball's Mount Rushmore by forging one of the strongest unions in America, creating a model for those in basketball, football and hockey.   When Mr. Miller was named executive director of the Major League Baseball Players Association in 1966, club owners ruled much as they had since the 19th century. The reserve clause bound players to their teams for as long as the owners wanted them, leaving them with little bargaining power. If Mr. Miller had one overarching achievement, it was to persuade professional athletes to cast aside the paternalism of the owners and to emerge as economic forces in their own right, armed with often immense bargaining power.","2012-11-27 15:20:40",161,17,"No","link","http://nyti.ms/SbTO3M","http://www.facebook.com/5281959998/posts/532455523449452"
